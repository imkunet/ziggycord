### Foreword

**this library is not production ready**

That doesn't mean it shouldn't be used to help, but keep your eyes peeled for breaking changes!
Do keep in mind that this is my absolute first Zig project, so any and all feedback would be
highly appreciated!

### Introduction

Finally! A way to write Discord bots in the Zig programming language.

### Project Goals
- [ ] Have documentation that exists
- [ ] Make a Discord bot that can do something
- [ ] Large endpoint coverage
- [ ] Convenience methods (or just documentation good enough where that's not necessary)
- [ ] Support features users of the library need

### Non-goals
- Squeezing every bit of performance out (at least for now)
- 100% endpoint coverage
